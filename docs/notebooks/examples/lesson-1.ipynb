    "# Semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, one would search through a corpus of documents using a keywords-based search engine like Lucene, Solr, ElasticSearch, etc. While the technology has matured, the basic underlying approach behind keyword search engines is to maintain an *inverted-index* mapping keywords to a list of documents that contain them, with associated relevances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the keywords-based search approach has been quite successful over the years, and have matured with added features and linguistic capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach has had its limitations. The principal cause of it goes to the fact that when we enter keywords, it is a human tendency to describe the intent of what we are looking for. For example, if we enter \"breakfast places\", we implicitly also mean restaurants, cafe, etc that serve items appropriate for breakfast. There may be a restaurant described as a shop for expresso, or crepe, that a keywords-search will likely miss, since its keywords do not match the query terms. And yet, we would hope to see it near the top of the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search is an NLP approach largely relying on deep-neural networks, and in particular, the transformers that make it possible to more closely infer the human intent behind the search terms, the relationship between the words, and the underlying context. It allows for entire sentences -- and even paragraphs -- describing what the searcher's intent is, and retrieves results more relevant or aligned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How would we do this NLP task with AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us represent the functional behavior we expect: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/semantic-search-functionality.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic happens: breaking it down into steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall that machine-learning algorithms work with vectors ($\\mathbf{X}$) representation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first order of business would be to map each of the document texts $D_i$ to its corresponding vector $X_i$ in an appropriate $d$-dimensional space, $\\mathbb{R}^d$, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "D_i \\longrightarrow X_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulting vectors are called **sentence embeddings**. Once these embeddings are for each of the documents, we can store the collection of tuples $[<D_1, X_1>, <D_2, X_2>, ..., <D_n, X_n>]$. Here each tuple corresponds to a document and its sentence embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of tuples, therefore, becomes our **search index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when the user described what she is looking for, we consider the entire text as a \"sentence\".\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-box alert-warning\" style=\"padding-top:30px\">\n",
    "   \n",
    "<b >Caveat Emptor</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that we have a rather relaxed definition of a *sentence* in NLP: it diverges from a grammmatical definition of a sentence somewhat.  For example, in the English language, we would consider a sentence to be terminated with a punctuation, such as a period, question-mark or exclamation. However, in NLP, we loosely consider the entire text -- whether it is just a word, or a few keywords, or an english sentence, or a few sentences together -- as one **sentence** for the purposes of natual language processing task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, it is common to consider an entire document text as a *sentence* if the text is relatively short. Alternatively, it is partitioned into smaller chunks (of say 512-tokens each), and each such chunk is considered an NLP *sentence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we consider the entire query text as a sentence, we can map it to its **sentence embedding vector**, ${Q}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector Similarity\n",
    "Once we have this, we simply need to compare the query vector ${Q}$ with each of the document vectors $X_i$, and sort the document vectors in descending order of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest is trivial: pick the top-k  in the sorted document vectors list. Then for each vector, look up its corresponding document, and return the list as sorted search result of relevant document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that these documents will exhibit high semantic similarity with the search query, assuming that the search index did contain such documents.\n",

    "#### Similarity measures\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence embedding vectors typically exist in very large dimensional space (e.g., 300 dimensions). In such large dimensional spaces, the notion of euclidean distance is not as effective. Therefore, it is far more common to use one of the two below measures for vector similarity:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Semantic search** is an information retrieval technique that understands the **meaning** and **context** of queries and documents, rather than just matching exact keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Keyword Search vs. Semantic Search\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Keyword Search | Semantic Search |\n",
    "|--------|----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Matching** | Exact text matches | Conceptual similarity |\n",
    "| **Understanding** | Lexical (word-level) | Semantic (meaning-level) |\n",
    "| **Query** | \"dog loyalty\" | \"dog loyalty\" |\n",
    "| **Finds** | Documents containing \"dog\" AND \"loyalty\" | Documents about faithful pets, even without exact words |\n",
    "| **Technology** | TF-IDF, BM25, Boolean logic | Neural embeddings, vector similarity |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Dense vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning\n",
    "- **Vector Space**: High-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned close together\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: Mathematical measure of how similar two vectors (meanings) are\n",
    "- **Dense Retrieval**: Finding relevant information based on semantic similarity rather than keyword overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Semantic Search? {#why}\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search has **revolutionized** information retrieval in several fundamental ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üéØ **1. Intent Understanding**\n",
    "- **Problem**: User searches \"best friend\" but documents say \"loyal companion\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Semantic search understands these concepts are related\n",
    "- **Impact**: 40-60% improvement in search relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üåê **2. Language Flexibility** \n",
    "- **Synonyms**: \"automobile\" matches \"car\", \"vehicle\", \"auto\"\n",
    "- **Paraphrasing**: \"How to cook pasta\" matches \"pasta preparation methods\"\n",
    "- **Multilingual**: Can work across languages with multilingual embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß† **3. Context Awareness**\n",
    "- **Polysemy**: \"bank\" (financial) vs \"bank\" (river) - context determines meaning\n",
    "- **Nuanced queries**: \"sad movie that makes you cry\" vs \"sad movie with bad reviews\"\n",
    "- **Conceptual search**: Find documents about concepts, not just keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìà **4. Transformational Impact on Industries**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Engines**: Google's BERT (2019) improved 10% of search queries\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Amazon's semantic search increased conversion rates by 15-25%\n",
    "- **Enterprise**: Microsoft's semantic search in Office 365 improved productivity\n",
    "- **Legal**: Semantic search helps lawyers find relevant case law beyond keyword matches\n",

    "## üéØ Key Takeaways {#takeaways}\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîë What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Search Revolution**\n",
    "   - Goes beyond keyword matching to understand **meaning**\n",
    "   - Uses neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships\n",
    "   - Transforms how we find and discover information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Technical Implementation**\n",
    "   - **Embeddings**: Dense vectors that represent semantic meaning\n",
    "   - **Vector Database**: Efficient storage and similarity search\n",
    "   - **Pipeline**: Data ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Embeddings ‚Üí Indexing ‚Üí Search\n",
    "   - **Architecture**: Composition pattern with SemanticSearch for code reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Benefits**\n",
    "   - **Intent Understanding**: Finds what you mean, not just what you say\n",
    "   - **Language Flexibility**: Works with synonyms, paraphrases, concepts\n",
    "   - **Better Relevance**: 40-60% improvement over keyword search\n",
    "   - **Natural Queries**: Search like you think and speak\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Applications**\n",
    "   - Document search and knowledge management\n",
    "   - E-commerce product discovery  \n",
    "   - Customer support and FAQ systems\n",
    "   - Research and academic databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In future lessons, we'll explore:\n",
    "- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combining search with LLMs\n",
    "- **Advanced Embeddings**: Domain-specific and multimodal models\n",
    "- **Vector Database Optimization**: Performance and scaling\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring search quality and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Semantic search doesn't just find documents that match your keywords‚Äîit finds documents that match your thoughts.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of semantic search lies in its ability to bridge the gap between human intent and information retrieval, making search more intuitive, effective, and intelligent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**üéâ Congratulations!** You've completed Lesson 1 and now understand the fundamentals of semantic search. You're ready to build more sophisticated RAG applications!\n"
